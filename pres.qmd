# Section 1: Fitting ODE Models

## Mechanistic Models for Infectious Diseases

We have some idea of how infectious diseases spread.

We can write (approximations of) them down mathematically.

A nice way is with ordinary differential equations:

$$\begin{gathered}
S_t = -\beta \frac{SI}{N}\\
I_t = \beta \frac{SI}{N} - \gamma I\\
R_t = \gamma I
\end{gathered}
$$


## Solving ODE Models

In general, we can write down a system of ODEs for the state $\vec{x}$ of the system with respect to some model parameters $\vec{\theta}$.

$$\vec{x}_t = \underbrace{f(\vec{x}, \vec{\theta})}_{RHS}$$

And we typically have to numerically integrate these systems in order to recover the state $\vec{x}$.

e.g. Euler's method
$$\vec{x}(t + \delta t) = \vec{x}(t) + f(\vec{x}(t), \vec{\theta}) \delta t$$

## Fitting ODEs: General Setup

Typically we will have some data $y(t)$ that we want to do two things with:

1. Predict $y(t + \Delta t)$, and
2. Understand underlying mechanisms, as abstracted by model parameters $\theta$.

And we have the setup:

$$\begin{gathered}
y = g(x) + \overbrace{\varepsilon}^{\text{error}}\\
x_t = f(x, \theta)
\end{gathered}$$

## Sales Pitch

Complex models are expensive to simulate, and thus expesive to infer.

Simple models are bad at capturing all the mechanisms.

We can get the <span style="color:#a161d9">b</span><span style="color:#F0DA16">e</span><span style="color:#a161d9">s</span><span style="color:#F0DA16">t </span><span style="color:#a161d9">o</span><span style="color:#F0DA16">f </span><span style="color:#a161d9">b</span><span style="color:#F0DA16">o</span><span style="color:#a161d9">t</span><span style="color:#F0DA16">h </span><span style="color:#a161d9">w</span><span style="color:#F0DA16">o</span><span style="color:#a161d9">r</span><span style="color:#F0DA16">l</span><span style="color:#a161d9">d</span><span style="color:#F0DA16">s</span> by using the simple model as a surrogate for the more complex model, and correcting the difference.

## How

Complex model: 
$$x(t) = \zeta(t; \theta, \eta)$$

Simple model: $$x(t) = s(t; \theta)$$

Correction term: $$C(t; \theta, \eta) = \zeta(t; \theta, \eta) - s(t;\theta)$$

too hard

## How
Complex model: 
$$x(t) = \zeta(t; \theta, \eta)$$

Simple model: $$x(t) = s(t; \theta)$$
